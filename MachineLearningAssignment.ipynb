Like many teachers at our school, I constantly work hard in focusing what each student needs to get them to be on the next academic level.\\\\r\\\\n  I work with them small and whole groups to more properly address the areas that they maybe struggling with.

Our students have various needs. I try to make my classroom a welcoming and warm place where they want to be. I love my students and only want the best for them. Like many teachers at our school, I constantly work hard in focusing what each student needs to get them to be on the next academic level.\\\\r\\\\n  I work with them small and whole groups to more properly address the areas that they maybe struggling with. All of this takes time and resources. Like many teachers, I try to purchase items that will help my students with their learning. \\\\r\\\\n  Our school recently became a STEAM school. Through science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics, our school wants to innovate our students to develop skills for the future.\",\n          \"My kindergarten students amaze me on a daily basis. EXCITEMENT and ENGAGEMENT while learning are my top goals as a kindergarten teacher. Keeping students excited about learning, and engaged in lessons starting in kindergarten, is key to a successful educational experience. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe 25 kindergarten students in my class attend an all day kindergarten session at CDSA.  \\\\r\\\\nCDSA is located in Boise, Idaho. This year we have expanded and are currently servicing 550 students grades K-6.  Our school is located in an urban Idaho district that services a diverse population of students. The students of my school come from a variety of economic backgrounds & situations, and are able to attend this public school of choice, for an opportunity to focus on the arts. \\\\r\\\\n\",\n          \"Students enjoy opening books and reading to each other. They get excited when they can connect the stories to information covered in our classroom, however, their choices are limited due to the small selection of non-fiction and fictional stories in our classroom library. Not only are they going to use these wonderful books in our classroom, but they will have the opportunity to read them at home. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI teach at a school where many of the students are not exposure to books selected for their reading levels at home.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI want to give my students an experience to find the joy and adventure in reading that I know can be achieved in our classroom! They deserve to have the best and that is what I want to provide for each and every single of my students.\\\\r\\\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"project_essay_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 87113,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This project is to gain the materials to create tangible 3D creations using our technology skills and artistic creativity to realize that there are applicable outcomes to what the students have been learning in class, or to see what collaboration with a parent or guardian can look like at during one of our community outreach activity nights!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThese 3D printer pens will be used in our class for making connections between our studies, art, and technology for several integrated units, and for use in our community outreach events (as a way for teachers, students, and parents to work together on a creating a tangible 3D printed item from our imaginations).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe will be printing bridges from our Portland History unit, forms of weather such as tornados or lightning from our weather unit, or even fossils for our paleontology unit!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe are excited to be creative in 3D with your help!\",\n          \"My students are excited for all of the new opportunities to keep it fit in and out of the classroom this year. Students thought that a great way to kick off our Keep it Fit theme would be to start a step count challenge. They came up with the idea of doing a 8 week Step it Up challenge that will restart throughout the year. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEach student will have a personalized daily/weekly step goal based on their average step count for one week prior to the start of the challenge. To be able to keep track of their daily steps students want to each have their pedometer. The SmartHealth Walking Fit Activity Tracker will be perfect for students to use during the school day to track how many steps they've taken, the distance they've gone, and what their heart rate is. Students will track their data in their science notebooks for the 8 weeks, which will be great practice in collecting and interpreting data! \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStudents thought that to go along with the Step it Up challenge access to great tasting filtered water and their own water tumblers would increase the amount of water students drink each day at school. The PUR water faucet filter will give students access to great tasting water. Many students don't bring their own water bottles to school and there is only one drinking fountain in our classroom. Each student will receive their own insulated water tumbler that they will keep at school.  Students want to make sure that everyone is hydrated and healthy!\",\n          \"My students are eager to read! Everyday we spend time in Guided Reading groups.

Like many teachers at our school, I constantly work hard in focusing what each student needs to get them to be on the next academic level.\\\\r\\\\n  I work with them small and whole groups to more properly address the areas that they maybe struggling with. All of this takes time and resources. Like many teachers, I try to purchase items that will help my students with their learning. \\\\r\\\\n  Our school recently became a STEAM school. Through science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics, our school wants to innovate our students to develop skills for the future.\",\n          \"My kindergarten students amaze me on a daily basis. EXCITEMENT and ENGAGEMENT while learning are my top goals as a kindergarten teacher. Keeping students excited about learning, and engaged in lessons starting in kindergarten, is key to a successful educational experience. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe 25 kindergarten students in my class attend an all day kindergarten session at CDSA.  \\\\r\\\\nCDSA is located in Boise, Idaho. This year we have expanded and are currently servicing 550 students grades K-6.  Our school is located in an urban Idaho district that services a diverse population of students. The students of my school come from a variety of economic backgrounds & situations, and are able to attend this public school of choice, for an opportunity to focus on the arts. \\\\r\\\\n\",\n          \"Students enjoy opening books and reading to each other. They get excited when they can connect the stories to information covered in our classroom, however, their choices are limited due to the small selection of non-fiction and fictional stories in our classroom library. Not only are they going to use these wonderful books in our classroom, but they will have the opportunity to read them at home. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI teach at a school where many of the students are not exposure to books selected for their reading levels at home.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI want to give my students an experience to find the joy and adventure in reading that I know can be achieved in our classroom!

Students thought that a great way to kick off our Keep it Fit theme would be to start a step count challenge. They came up with the idea of doing a 8 week Step it Up challenge that will restart throughout the year. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEach student will have a personalized daily/weekly step goal based on their average step count for one week prior to the start of the challenge. To be able to keep track of their daily steps students want to each have their pedometer. The SmartHealth Walking Fit Activity Tracker will be perfect for students to use during the school day to track how many steps they've taken, the distance they've gone, and what their heart rate is. Students will track their data in their science notebooks for the 8 weeks, which will be great practice in collecting and interpreting data! \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStudents thought that to go along with the Step it Up challenge access to great tasting filtered water and their own water tumblers would increase the amount of water students drink each day at school. The PUR water faucet filter will give students access to great tasting water. Many students don't bring their own water bottles to school and there is only one drinking fountain in our classroom. Each student will receive their own insulated water tumbler that they will keep at school.

Our students have various needs. I try to make my classroom a welcoming and warm place where they want to be. I love my students and only want the best for them. Like many teachers at our school, I constantly work hard in focusing what each student needs to get them to be on the next academic level.\\\\r\\\\n  I work with them small and whole groups to more properly address the areas that they maybe struggling with. All of this takes time and resources. Like many teachers, I try to purchase items that will help my students with their learning. \\\\r\\\\n  Our school recently became a STEAM school. Through science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics, our school wants to innovate our students to develop skills for the future.\",\n          \"My kindergarten students amaze me on a daily basis. EXCITEMENT and ENGAGEMENT while learning are my top goals as a kindergarten teacher. Keeping students excited about learning, and engaged in lessons starting in kindergarten, is key to a successful educational experience. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe 25 kindergarten students in my class attend an all day kindergarten session at CDSA.  \\\\r\\\\nCDSA is located in Boise, Idaho. This year we have expanded and are currently servicing 550 students grades K-6.  Our school is located in an urban Idaho district that services a diverse population of students. The students of my school come from a variety of economic backgrounds & situations, and are able to attend this public school of choice, for an opportunity to focus on the arts. \\\\r\\\\n\",\n          \"Students enjoy opening books and reading to each other. They get excited when they can connect the stories to information covered in our classroom, however, their choices are limited due to the small selection of non-fiction and fictional stories in our classroom library.

To be able to keep track of their daily steps students want to each have their pedometer. The SmartHealth Walking Fit Activity Tracker will be perfect for students to use during the school day to track how many steps they've taken, the distance they've gone, and what their heart rate is. Students will track their data in their science notebooks for the 8 weeks, which will be great practice in collecting and interpreting data! \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStudents thought that to go along with the Step it Up challenge access to great tasting filtered water and their own water tumblers would increase the amount of water students drink each day at school. The PUR water faucet filter will give students access to great tasting water. Many students don't bring their own water bottles to school and there is only one drinking fountain in our classroom.
